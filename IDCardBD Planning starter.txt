ROLE: Full-Stack .NET Developer
PROJECT: ID Card CMS (Education & Corporate)
TECH STACK: .NET 8, SQL Server, EF Core, AdminLTE 3 (Bootstrap), QuestPDF.

1. DATABASE STRUCTURE (SQL SERVER)
- Use Entity Framework Core Code-First.
- Create an abstract 'IdentityBase' class:
    - Common: Id (Int, PK), FullName, PhotoPath, QRCode, CreatedDate, Category (Enum).
- Create 'Student' class (inherits IdentityBase):
    - Fields: RollNumber, Grade, Section, GuardianName, Phone Number, FatherName, MotherName, Address, BloodGroup.
- Create 'Employee' class (inherits IdentityBase):
    - Fields: EmployeeCode, Designation, Department, BloodGroup.
- Create 'CardTemplate' table:
    - Fields: Name, FrontBgPath, BackBgPath, IsActive (Bool).

2. ADMIN DASHBOARD (ADMINLTE)
- Integrate AdminLTE 3 Layout into the .NET 8 project (Shared/_Layout.cshtml).
- Sidebar Navigation:
    - Dashboard (Stats: Total Students, Total Employees, Pending Prints).
    - Design Center (Upload Front/Back backgrounds).
    - Student Management (CRUD).
    - Employee Management (CRUD).
    - Print Queue (List of records ready for card generation).

3. MOBILE-FRIENDLY DATA ENTRY
- Forms: Use Bootstrap 'Card' components for clear spacing on mobile.
- Camera: Implement a JavaScript-interop camera module.
    - Path: /Capture/Camera
    - Function: Capture image from phone camera, convert to Base64/Blob, and preview instantly.
- Responsiveness: Ensure all tables use 'table-responsive' classes to be scrollable on small screens.

4. DUAL-SIDE DESIGN LOGIC
- Create a configuration page where the Admin uploads two distinct images (Front/Back).
- Logic: When generating the ID, the system must overlay dynamic text (Name, ID) and the Profile Photo onto the Front background, and static/institutional info on the Back background.

5. PRINTING ENGINE
- Library: QuestPDF.
- Output: Generate a single PDF with two pages (85.6mm x 53.98mm).
- Page 1: Dynamic Front Design.
- Page 2: Dynamic Back Design.
- DPI: Ensure 300 DPI rendering for crisp text on PVC cards.

6. TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
- Use Dependency Injection for Database Context.
- Use AutoMapper for DTO to Model conversion.
- Implement a 'PrintStatus' flag in the DB to track which IDs have already been printed.
